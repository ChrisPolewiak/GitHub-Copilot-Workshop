# Lab 09 — Generate README.md using Copilot

### 🎯 Goal

Use **Copilot Chat (Agent Mode)** to automatically generate a full `README.md` for the repository based on existing code.

---

## ✅ Task

1. Open Copilot Chat.
2. Ask Copilot to analyze the repo and generate a complete `README.md`.
3. Save the generated file as `README.md` in this folder.

> You should **not manually write documentation** — let Copilot produce it.

---

## 🔧 Prompts to use

### 1. Analyze repository

```
/explain Explain what this repository does, including each folder and lab.
```

### 2. Generate README

```
Generate a README.md that describes this project, goals of labs, structure of repository, and instructions on how to run the examples.
```

### 3. Optional — add diagram

```
Add an ASCII architecture diagram showing workflow: code → Copilot → result.
```

## ✅ Success criteria

* A new `README.md` file exists in this folder.
* README contains: overview, repository structure, usage, prerequisites.
* README was generated by Copilot — not written manually.
