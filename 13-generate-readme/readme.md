# Lab 08 – Generate documentation + architecture flow (SVG)

### 🎯 Goal

Use **GitHub Copilot** to:

1. Understand a multi-step code flow (order processing pipeline)
2. Generate documentation (docstrings + README)
3. Generate a **dependency flow diagram in SVG** from the code

> You are *not writing documentation manually*. Copilot creates all docs.

---

## 📂 Files provided

* `order_pipeline.py` – Python code with a real flow (pipeline of steps)

---

## 🧪 Task

### ✅ Step 1 – Understand the flow

Open `order_pipeline.py` and ask Copilot:

```
/explain What does this code do? Describe the flow of the order process.
```

### ✅ Step 2 – Generate docstrings

Select entire file → prompt:

```
/add-docstrings Add docstrings and inline comments so every method in the flow is explained.
```

### ✅ Step 3 – Generate README.md automatically

Prompt:

```
Generate README.md that explains the project, the order pipeline flow, and how to run the script.
```

### ✅ Step 4 – Generate architecture diagram (SVG)

Prompt:

```
Generate an SVG sequence / flow diagram based on the code. Each step in the pipeline should be a block.
```

If Copilot suggests code that generates a better visualization, apply it.

---

## ✅ Success criteria

* Code has docstrings + clear comments
* Copilot generated README.md (not you)
* A diagram SVG exists (generated by code or Copilot)
